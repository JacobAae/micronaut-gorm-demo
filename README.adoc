= Micronaut Gorm Demo

Experiments to get Gorm working in tests

== Running the application

 ./gradlew run

Shows 3 users

== Testing the application

 ./gradlew test

Fails with `No GORM implementations configured. Ensure GORM has been initialized correctly`


== Solution Branch

On the solution branch, there is a solution, but it seems clumsy. Creating a class which implements
`ApplicationEventListener<ServerStartupEvent>` that creates a HibernateDatastore if the environment is TEST.
