= Micronaut Gorm Demo

Experiments to get Gorm working in tests with Testcontainers

== Running the application

 ./gradlew run

Shows 3 users

== Testing the application

 ./gradlew test

The test is using Testcontainers, where part of the configuration is in the test itself (jdbc url etc.)
and part is in the `application-test.yml` file.


== Solution Branch - Don't do it like that

On the solution branch, there is a solution, but it seems clumsy. Creating a class which implements
`ApplicationEventListener<ServerStartupEvent>` that creates a HibernateDatastore if the environment is TEST.
